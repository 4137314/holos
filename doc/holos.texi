@chapter Introduction
HOLOS is a modular, extensible GNU scientific software platform for simulation, physical modeling, and engineering design. It provides a collaborative environment for scientific computation, peer-to-peer data sharing, and distributed computing. The codebase is written in C and follows GNU standards.

@node Overview
@chapter Overview
HOLOS supports a wide range of physics and engineering domains, including classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, relativity, thermodynamics, solid-state physics, nuclear physics, and more. The platform is organized into modular libraries and command-line tools, with support for peer-to-peer scientific collaboration using GNUnet.

@node Installation
@chapter Installation
To install HOLOS, use the standard GNU procedure:
@example
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check   # optional: run tests
$ make install
@end example

Dependencies include the GNU Scientific Library (GSL), GNUnet (optional for P2P), and standard C libraries. See the README for details.

@node Usage
@chapter Usage
After installation, you can use the main CLI tool:
@example
$ holos
@end example

You can also link against the HOLOS libraries in your own C programs. Include the relevant headers from @file{include/}.

@node Modules
@chapter Modules
HOLOS is organized into the following main modules:

@itemize @bullet
@item @b{Physics:} Classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, relativity, thermodynamics, solid-state, nuclear, astrophysics, electromagnetism, and more.
@item @b{AI:} Neural network models (MLP, CNN, RNN, GAN, Transformer) in @file{include/core/ai/}.
@item @b{P2P:} Peer-to-peer scientific collaboration using GNUnet.
@item @b{CLI:} Command-line interface for running simulations and managing models.
@end itemize

Each module is documented in its own header and source files. See the @file{include/} and @file{src/} directories for details.

@node Development
@chapter Development
HOLOS follows the GNU coding standards. The build system uses GNU Autotools (@file{configure.ac}, @file{Makefile.am}).

@itemize @bullet
@item Source code: @file{src/}
@item Headers: @file{include/}
@item Documentation: @file{doc/}
@item Tests: @file{tests/}
@end itemize
