SYNOPSIS
--------
holos is a scientific software platform for simulation, physical modeling, and engineering design. It provides a collaborative environment for scientific computation, peer-to-peer data sharing, and distributed computing.

FEATURES
--------
- Comprehensive physics simulation: classical, analytical, quantum, relativistic mechanics, astrophysics, electromagnetism, nuclear, solid-state, and thermodynamics.
- Modular C codebase with GNU Scientific Library (GSL) and GNUnet support.
- Peer-to-peer distributed scientific collaboration and computing.
- Export to major data formats and automatic LaTeX reports.
- Command-line interface (CLI) and modular compilation.

COPYRIGHT
---------
See the file LICENSE for copying conditions.

INSTALLATION
------------
To compile and install HOLOS, use the standard GNU procedure:

  1. Unpack the source code:
     $ tar xvf holos-x.y.tar.gz
     $ cd holos-x.y

  2. Configure the package for your system:
     $ ./configure [OPTIONS]
     Common options:
       --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
       --enable-optimizations  enable SIMD and compiler optimizations
       --enable-debug          include debugging symbols

  3. Build and install:
     $ make
     $ make check      # optional: run tests
     $ make install

USAGE
-----

To use the HOLOS C API, include the relevant headers in your programs:

  #include <holos/mechanics/classical/dynamics.h>
  #include <holos/astro/celestial_mechanics.h>

You can run simulations via the command-line interface or integrate the API into your own scientific workflows. Each module provides functions for physical quantities, numerical integration, and vectorized computations using GSL.

DEVELOPMENT
-----------
HOLOS follows the GNU coding standards. The build system uses GNU Autotools:
  - configure.ac defines the build configuration.
  - Makefile.am contains compilation rules.
  - Header files are in `include/`.
  - Source files are in `src/`.

Contributions are welcome. Use the `unstable` branch for experimental features and submit pull requests for review.
