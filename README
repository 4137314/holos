HOL0S  - Scientific Simulation and Engineering Modeling Framework
=================================================================

Holos is a scientific software platform for simulation, physical modeling,
and engineering design. It aims to provide researchers and engineers with
a collaborative environment for scientific computation and peer-to-peer
scientific data sharing.

Features
--------

* **Comprehensive Physics Simulation**
  - Classical, analytical, quantum, and relativistic mechanics.
  - Astrophysics and orbital dynamics.
  - Electromagnetic field theory.
  - Nuclear physics, solid-state physics, and thermodynamics.

* **Extensible Architecture**
  - Modular C codebase with GNU Scientific Library (GSL) support.
  - Runtime extensibility for user-defined physical models and technology projects.
  - Project manager to create, organize, and maintain new models and workflows.

* **Collaboration and Workflow**
  - Peer-to-peer distributed scientific collaboration using GNUnet.
  - Technology stacks for modular and reproducible creation of new scientific tools.

* **Output and Documentation**
  - Export to major physics and engineering data formats.
  - Automatic LaTeX reports for simulations and technology results.
  - Integrated code documentation and PDF manuals of included models.

* **Interfaces and Usability**
  - Multiple user interfaces: shell, CLI, TUI, and GUI.
  - Modular compilation: build only what you need.

Installation
------------

1. Unpack the source code:

   $ tar xvf holos-x.y.tar.gz
   $ cd holos-x.y

2. Configure the build system:

   $ ./configure [OPTIONS]

   Typical options:

   --prefix=PREFIX       install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
   --enable-optimizations  enable SIMD and compiler optimizations
   --enable-debug        include debugging symbols

3. Build and install:

   $ make
   $ make check      # optional: run tests
   $ make install

Usage
-----

Holos provides a modular C API. Include the relevant headers in your
programs:

   #include <holos/mechanics/classical/dynamics.h>
   #include <holos/astro/celestial_mechanics.h>

Run simulations via command-line tools or integrate the API into your own
scientific workflows. Each module contains functions for physical
quantities, numerical integration, and vectorized computations using GSL.

Development
-----------

Holos follows GNU coding standards. The build system uses Autotools:

- configure.ac defines the build configuration.
- Makefile.am contains compilation rules.
- Header files reside in `include/`.
- Source files reside in `src/`.

Contributions are welcome. Use the `unstable` branch for experimental
features, and submit pull requests for review.
