HOL0S  - Scientific Simulation and Engineering Modeling Framework
=================================================================

Holos is a scientific software platform for simulation, physical modeling,
and engineering design. It aims to provide researchers and engineers with
a collaborative environment for scientific computation and peer-to-peer
scientific data sharing.

Features
--------

- Classical, analytical, quantum, and relativistic mechanics simulations.
- Astrophysics and orbital dynamics modeling.
- Electromagnetic field simulations.
- Solid state, nuclear, and thermodynamics modules.
- Extensible C codebase with GSL (GNU Scientific Library) support.
- Peer-to-peer collaboration features for distributed scientific workflows.

Installation
------------

1. Unpack the source code:

   $ tar xvf holos-x.y.tar.gz
   $ cd holos-x.y

2. Configure the build system:

   $ ./configure [OPTIONS]

   Typical options:

   --prefix=PREFIX       install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
   --enable-optimizations  enable SIMD and compiler optimizations
   --enable-debug        include debugging symbols

3. Build and install:

   $ make
   $ make check      # optional: run tests
   $ make install

Usage
-----

Holos provides a modular C API. Include the relevant headers in your
programs:

   #include <holos/mechanics/classical/dynamics.h>
   #include <holos/astro/celestial_mechanics.h>

Run simulations via command-line tools or integrate the API into your own
scientific workflows. Each module contains functions for physical
quantities, numerical integration, and vectorized computations using GSL.

Development
-----------

Holos follows GNU coding standards. The build system uses Autotools:

- configure.ac defines the build configuration.
- Makefile.am contains compilation rules.
- Header files reside in `include/`.
- Source files reside in `src/`.

Contributions are welcome. Use the `unstable` branch for experimental
features, and submit pull requests for review.
